# odin-recipes  

06 December 2022

This is the first small real project with The Odin Project, in the Foundations curricula. 

At the end of this I should be able to 

    1. put together the initial structure of a website
    2. create pages for every recipe
    3. put content inside said pages
    4. all the while committing to git and commenting clearly 
     
Onward!
